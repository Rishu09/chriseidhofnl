  <section class="postbody">
    <p>A few weeks ago, after Apple announced their new programming language Swift, it
became very clear to me that we had to write a book on <a href="http://www.objc.io/books/">Functional Programming
in Swift</a>. Once the idea was there, I just couldn&rsquo;t stop
thinking about it anymore. After getting <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004/">Wouter</a> and <a href="http://floriankugler.com">Florian</a> on board, I knew we had a killer team for writing this book.</p>

<p>We decided to do give people early access, so they can read along and comment
as we proceed with the writing. So far, the response has been really great, and I&rsquo;m really happy that we chose to do this. It works like this: after people buy the early access version, we immediately grant them access to a GitHub repository where they can read and comment on the chapters we&rsquo;ve written so far.</p>

<p>One of the things I only realized after we started: if we do this right, we
might write a book that is still relevant in 5 or 10 years. The book is not
about any specific frameworks, it&rsquo;s about doing functional programming.
Frameworks might change a lot, the principles of functional programming have been the same for a really long time.
Because we write our chapters using <a href="https://github.com/chriseidhof/literate-swift">literate
programming</a> it&rsquo;s very easy for
us to update them later on as the language evolves.</p>

<p>After we brainstormed a lot of ideas (way more than we could possibly fit into
one book) we picked the best ones, and starting writing chapter outlines and example
code. I&rsquo;m so excited about some of the examples we&rsquo;ll show you: they make
things that were previously complex now very simple. Functional programming can
be like that: making certain programs smaller by a huge factor.</p>

<p>What I love about Swift is that it allows us to mix functional and
object-oriented programming. We can keep doing all the great stuff that we
know, we can keep using all of Apple&rsquo;s great APIs, but at the same time we can
write parts of our program in a functional style. This book will hopefully show
you examples where the functional style is way more powerful.</p>
