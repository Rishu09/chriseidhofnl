    <p>This morning at 10:11 GMT+1, version 1.0 of Met was submitted to the App Store.
It&#8217;s been quite an experience, blogging about everything, from before there was
an idea until the App Store submission. I will write a recap of everything next
week.</p>

<p>In the last few days, I&#8217;ve been helping out with an ultra marathon, and met a
lot of interesting and inspiring people. There was a 73-year old guy who
ran 160 kilometers (100 miles) who finished without any problems. Very
impressive. After the race, I travelled to MÃ¡laga and yesterday I got back to
The Netherlands. During this time, I felt bad for not writing about Met, as it
was almost ready. Yesterday, I fixed a last bug while I was waiting on the
airport.</p>

<p>Travelling always makes me come up with new thoughts. The faster I travel, the
bigger the thoughts seem to be. As I was in an airplane yesterday, I had some
high-level ideas about what to do with my life.</p>

<p>At this moment, I found out that making enough money from selling my own products is a little
harder than I thought. However, I really love what I&#8217;m  doing, and I&#8217;m having a
great time. It is probably going to take me longer than I expected to be able to
live off of the passive income made from my apps, but I&#8217;m not worried about
that. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll do some client projects (anybody looking for an iOS
developer?).</p>

<p>Now that the first version of Met is submitted to the App Store, it&#8217;s almost time for
some other projects. I still need to write a press release and send it out, but
after that is fully prepared I look forward to work on some other projects. One thing
I&#8217;ll be working is the <a href="/post/9873846899/ive-got-an-idea-for-an-app">super-secret
project</a>
I wrote about earlier. The physical prototypes are almost ready, and the first
version of the iPhone app too. Also, <a href="http://ulischoeberl.com/">Uli</a> and I are
going to spend a week getting the app done that we&#8217;ve worked on and talked about
for the last few months.</p>

<p>I love running, and have been training quite heavily for the last 1.5 years. I
track all my running using my Garmin 405 watch, and all the activities are
uploaded to Garmin Connect, a webservice for analyzing everything about your
workout. However, they don&#8217;t have an iPhone or iPad client, and I would love to
have a decent app for that. This is one of the ideas I&#8217;m thinking about building next.</p>
