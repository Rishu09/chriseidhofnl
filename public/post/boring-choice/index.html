    <p>I love new and experimental technologies. These days, I like trying to push Swift to the limits. I once wrote a Haskell web backend for financial transactions that used lots of generic programming. When Rails was just out, I started playing around with it (back when hosting was really complicated, except if you wanted PHP3 and MySQL). I&rsquo;ve used all these things in production code, mainly in very small teams.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.getscenery.com">Scenery</a>, we also had to write a backend. I debated using Swift (but hosting would&rsquo;ve been a pain), or maybe something like Haskell or Scala. The cool kids seem to be doing Go and Elixir these days. It&rsquo;d have been lots of fun. However, I went for one of the most boring choices: Ruby on Rails. Rails is at version 4, and even though a lot has changed, it is also very mainstream these days. This means there&rsquo;s a lot less exciting technology to play around with.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons for choosing Rails:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s very widely used and tested. During this project, I haven&rsquo;t come across any bugs in Rails.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s really easy to get help. Most of the times, I don&rsquo;t even need to ask, but just google my problem and I&rsquo;ll quickly find out what&rsquo;s going wrong.</li>
<li>There are <em>so many</em> libraries available. This is a killer feature: I wanted to keep a history of some of my model objects, and found out about <a href="https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail">papertrail</a>. For testing, I can use <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">FactoryGirl</a>. For authentication, we use <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">devise</a>.</li>
<li>The eco-system is great, Heroku takes away a lot of deployment worries.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, one of the most important things is that anybody on our team can contribute. With Haskell, there would have been a decent chance that I would be the only one even being able to build the project. With Rails, none of the people we work with had to learn anything new: they were productive immediately. I recently came across this African proverb, and thought it fitted well to our situation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>If you want to go fast, go alone. if you want to go far, go together.</em></p>
</blockquote>

)</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m really happy with the boring choice. Being able to get many hands on deck quickly really made a big difference. Hardly having to worry about stability and deployment helps me sleep at night. And finally, knowing that whenever I have a problem, others will have had the same problem saves me heaps of time. Luckily, we&rsquo;ve written the Mac app entirely in Swift, with lots of functional code, so there&rsquo;s always a place left to play with new technology.</p>
