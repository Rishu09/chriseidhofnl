    <p>As I&#8217;m enjoying programming again (and more so every week), I started to think
consciously again about improving myself as a programmer. After a recommendation
of <a href="http://twitter.com/breun">breun</a> I started reading <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/academic/product/1,3110,0132350882,00.html">Clean Code</a>, which I can definitely recommend.</p>

<p>One of the things I have always felt bad about professionally is not doing
Test-Driven Development. Back when I was programming Haskell a lot I did do a
lot of type-driven development, which overlaps a bit: you write down your types
and then try to implement it.  However, in Objective-C the type system isn&#8217;t of
much use (compared to Haskell), so I really had to do it: write tests.</p>

<p>Another really big motivation is that I took over a project from another
developer. The project was huge, and there were no tests at all. I ended up
breaking things multiple times without realizing it (and I only found out after
deploying it to the testers). I pledged to myself to do better than that.</p>

<p>Before I set off to write some tests, I had to find a testing framework. There
is a great community wiki on StackOverflow called <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114083/ios-tests-specs-tdd-bdd-and-integration-acceptance-testing">iOS Tests/Specs TDD/BDD and
Integration &amp; Acceptance
Testing</a>,
but it&#8217;s also a bit overwhelming.</p>

<p>I started out by using the built-in Unit
Testing framework that&#8217;s provided by Apple (see: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/UnitTesting/">XCode Unit Testing
Guide</a>).
However, writing unit tests is quite hard for GUI code. As I wanted to test a
new UIView subclass that I was developing, I had to test things such as tapping
and inspecting other views.</p>

<p>Then I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/square/KIF">KIF</a> (again, after a recommendation from breun), an open source
integration testing framework by Square. As advertised, it was easy to configure
and set up, and I was writing tests very soon after that. For example, here&#8217;s a
scenario that tests whether my view closes, and even when you haven&#8217;t used KIF
before you can understand exactly what it does:</p>

<pre><code>KIFTestScenario *scenario = [KIFTestScenario scenarioWithDescription:@"Test that the picker closes when tapped outside"];

[scenario addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToReset]];
[scenario addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToAppear]];
[scenario addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToWaitForViewWithAccessibilityLabel:pickerAccessibilityLabel]];
[scenario addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToTapViewWithAccessibilityLabel:@"Tap to close"]];
[scenario addStep:[KIFTestStep stepToWaitForAbsenceOfViewWithAccessibilityLabel:pickerAccessibilityLabel]];
</code></pre>

<p>So far, I&#8217;m quite happy with the combination of KIF and the built-in unit
testing. I&#8217;ll try to apply it to more of my projects, and probably be a better
programmer because of that. At least when other people will read my code they
can use the tests as documentation to see what the code should do.</p>
