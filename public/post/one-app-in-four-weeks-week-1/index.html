    <p>This Monday, I started <a href="/post/10680838726/one-app-in-four-weeks-kickoff">One App in Four
Weeks</a>.
I started by posting a list of ideas. The third idea was the most appealling to
people (although I still want to build the other two as well, but not now), and
I got some great feedback from everybody.</p>

<p>I selected the idea and <a href="/post/10723613553/check-in-to-people">defined the Minimum Viable
Product</a>,
which is quite simple: you can check in to people, add a time and note to that
checkin and possibly a location as well.</p>

<p>Yesterday I wrote about the first <a href="/post/10801169656/sketches-and-ideas">sketches and
ideas</a>, and
after that I started working on the very first version.</p>

<p>Normally I don&#8217;t show these first versions to people, but because I want to show
you all the steps I&#8217;ll include the screenshots today. The app is barely
functional: you see a list of Checkins, and when you press the &#8216;+&#8217; button it
shows the list of your contacts in Address Book. Tapping on a contact takes you
to the &#8216;Add Checkin&#8217; screen, where you can add a note. The time is not
changeable yet, and the location isn&#8217;t implemented at all. When you then press
&#8216;Done&#8217; you&#8217;ll go back to the start screen, and the checkin was added. You can
also edit it again by tapping on it.</p>

<p>For the location, I&#8217;m thinking of using the Foursquare API, which can provide
you with venue information based on lat/lon. I&#8217;ll probably store the locations
and try to find a previously used location when possible (about half the time I
meet people it&#8217;s in the same places).</p>

<p>I also had some ideas about searching: I want to index all the words in the
checkin database, and do autocompletion using those words. This means that
searching can be a very fast experience. Search could probably be quite
important: I can also imagine it&#8217;s handy if I want to find a PHP developer in my
network (I always forget who knows which languages).</p>
