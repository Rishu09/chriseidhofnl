    <p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been a bit obsessed with writing simpler code. It
happened because I passed on some projects to other programmers. I would
like to feel minimally embarrassed when doing so.</p>

<p>In the projects I&#8217;ve taken over from other people, one of the most
common problems is that view controller code is big and complicated.
In this article, we&#8217;ll look at some ways to make the view controller
smaller and thus simpler. In a project I&#8217;m working on currently, we have
about 150 classes, and almost none of them is larger than 100 lines. The
ones that are larger than that are on the top of my refactoring list.</p>

<h1>Separate out UITableViewDataSource and UITableViewDelegate</h1>

<p>One of the first things I often do is create a separate class for the
tableView&#8217;s data source and delegate. Just create a new class, take all
the methods that start with <code>tableView:</code> and put them in there. The
compiler will then show you which things are missing in that class (e.g.
instance variables), and you pass them on. Then you can remove them from
the view controller.</p>

<h1>Don&#8217;t do domain logic</h1>

<p>Most of my apps are backed by a Core Data stack (but this is true for any
kind of data store). I Try to do as little domain logic as possible. For
Core Data, my favorite trick is to add a category to the generated
models where I put my logic. For example, instead of doing this in your
view controller:</p>

<pre><code>- (Department*)getRootDepartment:(Department*)department {
  if(department.parent == nil) return department;
  return [self getRootDepartment:department.parent];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Do this in <code>Department+Extensions.m</code>:</p>

<pre><code>- (Department*)rootDepartment {
  if(self.parent == nil) return self;
  return [self rootDepartment];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even for small methods like this, it helps a lot to keep your view
controllers small. You also have the added benefit that it&#8217;s much easier
to reuse this code.</p>

<h1>Don&#8217;t do webservice logic</h1>

<p>Don&#8217;t call and parse a webservice request in your view controller.</p>

<p>I always create a separate set of classes that do the dealing with
webservices. It depends how complicated your webservice / persistency
is, but I mostly have a class called <code>Webservice</code> that gives you
high-level methods to call the webservice. Either the methods accept
callbacks or I use KVO (more about that later). It uses the &#8220;fire and
forget&#8221; approach: you tell the webservice that you want something and
then forget, assume it will get back to you at some point.</p>

<p>The webservice class calls the API and turns the API results into domain
objects. This functionality is often achieved by multiple classes that
are used by the webservice, but that&#8217;s a topic for a later post.</p>

<h1>Don&#8217;t create complicated view hierarchies</h1>

<p>Don&#8217;t set up complicated view hierarchies in your view controller.
Personally, I&#8217;m a big fan of designing my views in a nib/xib/storyboard.
But even if you don&#8217;t, I think it&#8217;s better to compose several views into
a new view. For example, if you want a date slider, it&#8217;s better to
create the view hierarchy for that (the labels at the axes, a label
representing the current date and the UISlider) in a separate class.</p>

<h1>Create child view controllers</h1>

<p>Since iOS 5, it&#8217;s very easy to create child view controllers. Use this
functionality. It makes your life easier. This is mostly useful for iPad
apps, but might be useful for iPhone apps as well. A classical example
of this is the split view, but in any screen where you have components
that are almost independent it might be useful.</p>

<h1>Use KVO</h1>

<p>Key value observing can make your life a lot easier. It&#8217;s also a bit
tricky sometimes, so you do need to spend some time to learn it, and you
will probably make some mistakes (I still get tripped up every now and then).</p>

<p>One example
where KVO really shines is the <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code>. It listens
to changes in core data objects and can be used to implement a
<code>UITableViewDataSource</code> or <code>UICollectionViewDataSource</code>.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you have a list of
<code>Departments</code>. Then you want to refresh that list from the API. In your
view controller, you fire a off a request like <code>[webservice
reloadDepartments]</code> and then forget. Once the webservice updates the
Core Data managed objects, magic happens: Because you implemented your
<code>UITableViewDataSource</code> using an <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code>, it gets
refreshed automatically.</p>

<p>KVO by itself can be a bit hairy sometimes, and there are small
libraries like
<a href="https://github.com/th-in-gs/THObserversAndBinders">THObserversAndBinders</a>
that make things easier.</p>

<h1>Other ideas?</h1>

<p>This is just a list of things that I could come up with and common
refactorings I use. I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of things I forgot, let me
know your tips and I&#8217;ll add them to the article.</p>
