I'm Chris Eidhof. Dutch, and living in Berlin.


I wrote two books: [Functional Programming in Swift](http://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift) and [Advanced Swift](http://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift) at [objc.io](http://www.objc.io).

I built iOS and Mac apps. In 2014, we released [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com). It's a Mac app that lets you create beautiful presentations, straight from Markdown. In 2015, we built [Scenery](http://www.getscenery.com), which lets you present your app designs using great photography.

In 2013 we started [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com), an independent conference for serious iOS developers. It is now run by other people. In 2014 and 2015 I organized the [Functional Swift Conference](http://2015.funswiftconf.com) together with Brandon. I enjoy speaking at conferences and meetups, [here](https://github.com/chriseidhof/speaking)'s a list of recent talks.
